#### Found Bugs

First make sure the bug hasn't been reported yet. New bugs found can be submitted to the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/swttt/HomeyDash/issues/new) .
And if you already know a good solution, feel free to make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/swttt/HomeyDash/pulls)!

#### Pull Requests

Pull requests can be done on the develop branch. Until the master branch isn't stable enough (and is considered alpha/beta) the develop branch won't get build and pushed for now. After the master branch is more stable, i will auto build the develop branch to a seperate sub-domain.

#### Plug-ins

Currently there isn't any documentation yet on how to create plugins. Plug-ins are functional, and will be merged once aproved.

A good example of a plug-in is the `power-usage` plugin that you can find in `/src/components/plugins/power-usage`.

Don't forget to add your plugin to the `/src/components/plugins/index.js`!
